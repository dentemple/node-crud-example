# Node.js CRUD Example

## Installation

## Requirements

Your mission if you choose to accept is to build the backend which allows the following to be editable:

Use Node.JS to build a CRU app (the backend) for the above cards. Determine an appropriate schema for some version of persistent storage (database or similar) which allows you to edit the cards. The schema should ideally be flexible enough to work with any other card including the one displayed as an example, and other different cards. A user should be able to Create, Read, and Update a persistently stored JSON representation sufficient to edit any fields in the above components.

For example, a user should be able to update the 3rd component in the list to say: just: “Brahma Light” rather than “Brahma Light very very light 33 Onz – Caja [12 Botellas]”, and a user can get ALL the data needed to build this specific page.

Bonuses:

- Test-Driven Development: Have tests, README.md for each component.
- TypeScript: Bonus if you can do it all in TypeScript
- Orderable Tiles: Make users be able to re-order the tiles.
- Orderable Tile Content: Make users be able to re-order the content within the tile (move the image to the bottom, and the add to cart button to the top, etc.).
- Frontend: Add a frontend so the user’s edits can be live previewed (probably not enough time for this, finish the other piece before you start with this)
- WYSIWYG: The user can edit not just the text, but also styling, classes.
- DevOps: Set up a Dockerfile so this can be deployed.
